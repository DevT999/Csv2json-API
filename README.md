# backend-dev-challenge
The backend developer challenge from Ichi Studios

The challenge:
Please fork this repository & create an extensible project that converts a json into a csv with nested headers. 

## Notes:

* Please use either Ruby or Javascript. It is completely up to you if you want to use a library / framework or build it from     scratch.

* Try using a test-driven approach. 

* Please commit often so we can see the process. If code is not refactored yet in a commit, that's perfectly fine. We want to   see how you work and your style of programming. 

* Take a maximum of three days for this. It's not about seeing a perfect solution, more about assesing your current level.

* You can find a CSV file and a JSON file in the data folder to use as a reference or for your tests.
